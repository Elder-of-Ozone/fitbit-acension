This is just a few python scripts that I've put together to link my fitbit.

I have two main script templates.

The first is the production template.
	The production template is the final result.
	This script contains a loop running continuously.
	Thereby, it needs to refresh access tokens from fitbit's OAuth2

The second script is for testing.
	This allows quick test runs to occur in hourly intervals before
	the tokens run out

Will add tutorials in wordpress at later date.
